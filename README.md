# Charan Photopedia – Sidebar Prototype

A basic front-end prototype of a photography-themed website sidebar, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

## 🔍 About the Project

This is a simple UI prototype for a sidebar navigation menu. It includes:
- A hidden sidebar that slides in/out using a hamburger menu (checkbox trick)
- Creative use of pure CSS to toggle sidebar visibility
- Placeholder menu sections like Gallery, Events, Store, Contact, etc.
- Responsive and modern layout inspired by photography themes

> ⚙️ This was a personal practice project to explore creative layout techniques without using JavaScript.
